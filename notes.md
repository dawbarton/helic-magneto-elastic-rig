# Magneto-elastic rig notes

Hardware verification status and bring-up constraints for this rig. Read and
update this file when doing hardware work. Software checks establish neither
electrical nor real-time behaviour; only evidence recorded here does.

Platform-level notes (the shared real-time architecture, the embassy-time alarm
loss and its watchdog) stay in the HELIC-DAQ platform repository's `notes.md`.
Evidence recorded here starts at the creation of this repository on
2026-08-12; hardware evidence from before that date is held in the platform
repository and describes this rig under its former firmware name.

## Verification status

**Hardware-verified**, on a W5500-EVB-Pico2 with the interim analogue cape:
the 8 kHz hardware-clocked acquisition path, the DAC output path, networking,
discovery, the parameter registry, and UDP streaming of all 15 sources. The
figures under "Bring-up evidence" below are the current acceptance record.

The exciter drive is only as safe as the limits in `src/config.rs`, and those
limits are compile-time constants that describe the fitted hardware. Re-check
them, and `DAC_POLARITY` in `src/rig.rs`, against the hardware before every
change of analogue board, specimen, or exciter.

## Standing hardware constraints

- **optoNCDT RX pull-up.** GP1 needs an external 10 kΩ pull-up to 3V3. Without
  it a disconnected or unpowered sensor leaves the line floating, and the UART
  free-runs into a framing/break interrupt storm that livelocks core 0. The
  symptom is a rig that boots and then stops answering on the network.
- **Analogue output stages.** The fitted cape is all-unipolar, and
  `DAC_POLARITY` in `src/rig.rs` is set to match. Channel A drives the
  exciter's positive differential input and channel C holds the negative
  reference at the 2.048 V common mode; channel B is broken and channel D is
  unused, so both rest at 0 V. Output routing is fixed to channel A and
  `rig_out_channel` will reject any other value.
- **Laser measuring rate.** The optoNCDT is configured at startup from
  `SAMPLE_RATE`, and expects the factory 921.6 kBaud setting.
- **Flashing.** Flash with `cargo run --release`, which uses `probe-rs run`.
  `probe-rs download` on its own has been observed to leave the target halted,
  which presents as a board that has vanished from the network; recover with
  `cargo run --release`.
- **Sequential host access.** The control server is single-client. A host
  process killed mid-request leaves the connection held until it times out,
  and the next connection attempt will fail meanwhile.
- **A silent laser has twice taken the rig off the network.** When the
  optoNCDT stops answering, the platform's driver probes baud rates about four
  times a second and does not stop. On 2026-08-12 the rig twice became absent
  from the host (`No route to host`, or connections that time out) while defmt
  showed core 1 ticking normally at 8 kHz; in that state `records_dropped`
  climbed to 833369 with streaming *off*, so core 0 was not draining the ring
  and the network stack was not being serviced. A reset clears it.
  The probe loop alone is not sufficient, though: with the same silent sensor
  later the same afternoon, the probing continued at about five per second
  while drops stayed at zero and the full regression passed. Treat a silent
  sensor as the precondition and check it, and its GP1 pull-up, physically.
  Open platform defect, with the evidence in the HELIC-DAQ repository's
  `notes.md`.
- **Interrupted captures do not leave the rig streaming.** An earlier revision
  of this file said they did. They do not: killing a client sends a FIN and
  the control server stops the stream in the same defmt millisecond. Since
  platform `v0.1.3` the streamer also refuses to send at all without an open
  control connection.

## Bring-up evidence

### Repository split and firmware rename (2026-08-12)

This rig moved into its own repository, pinned to platform tag `v0.1.2`, and
its advertised experiment name changed. The rename is wire-visible: discovery
and the `experiment` parameter now report `magnetoelastic`, and the rig profile
selects it as `--rig magnetoelastic`. Nothing else about the firmware changed,
and this bring-up exists to show that.

Exact clean W5500 firmware `0.1.0 86a5262` reported protocol 3, 42 parameters,
15 sources at 8 kHz, and safety disarmed at boot (`arm = 0`).

- `helic-rt-regression --profile rig-profile.toml`, flashing the default build:
  idle, TCP-poll and capture phases at 7999.8–8000.2 ticks/s with zero
  overruns, tick timeouts, dropped records, lost packets, capture drops or
  index gaps. `loop_time_max` 38 µs against the profile's 60 µs limit;
  `wake_phase` 36 µs, `t_measure_max` 19 µs, `t_actuate_max` 4 µs,
  `t_rest_max` 16 µs.
- `--no-flash --capture-sources all --capture-samples 8000` on the same image:
  8000 records of all 15 sources (`adc0`–`adc7`, `laser`, `target`, `forcing`,
  `table`, `phase`, `out`, `cmd_epoch`) with the same zero counters,
  7999.5–8000.3 ticks/s and `loop_time_max` 38 µs.
- Static gates on the same tree: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`,
  `helic-deps-check`, and `helic-rt-layout` against `rig-profile.toml` all
  passed; the W6100 variant cross-built but was not flashed.

The specimen was not driven: the safety gate stayed disarmed throughout, so
this is evidence about the acquisition, timing and communications paths, not
about closed-loop behaviour.

### Platform upgrade to v0.1.3 (2026-08-12)

Repinned from `v0.1.2`. A patch release, so no rig code changed; the control
link now uses a 2 s TCP keep-alive with a 10 s timeout instead of a 30 s
timeout with no probes.

Exact clean W5500 firmware `0.1.0 a594cc5`, built against the tag:

- an idle control connection that this rig reset after exactly 30.0 s before
  the upgrade was still open after 90 s, so an arm-and-hold session no longer
  needs to poll to stay connected;
- `helic-rt-regression --profile rig-profile.toml --no-flash` passed every
  phase at 7999.9–8000.3 ticks/s with zero overruns, tick timeouts, dropped
  records, lost packets, capture drops or index gaps, and `loop_time_max`
  37 µs against the unchanged 60 µs limit;
- `cargo fmt`, release clippy, `helic-deps-check` and `helic-rt-layout` all
  passed against the repinned tree, and the W6100 variant cross-built.

The comms-loss window that disarms the output and stops the stream after a
host vanishes without closing its connection is now about 10 s rather than 30.
That path was not exercised directly: making this host stop answering without
closing the connection needs privileges not available here, so the bound rests
on the keep-alive mechanism, whose live half is what the 90 s test above
demonstrates.

The laser was not answering during this session (`laser_frames_received` = 0,
`safety` = 10, i.e. tripped and quieting). The figures above are therefore
evidence about the acquisition, timing and communications paths only.
